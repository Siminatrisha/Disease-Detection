## Introduction
This project aims to leverage machine learning to detect diseases in tomato plants from images. Early detection of diseases can help in taking preventive measures to protect the crop and ensure better yield.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 10083 images of tomato leaves, categorized into healthy and diseased classes. The images were sourced from a publicly available dataset (dataset from kaggle).

## Model
The model is built using Xception which is a one type of a convolutional neural network architecture that particularly suitable for image classification and modeling It is an extension of the Inception architecture that replaces the standard Inception modules with depthwise separable convolutions, which can lead to more efficient models with fewer parameters while maintaining high performance. By leveraging this particular model about 82% disease is detectable accurately that properly alligns to real world scenarios.
